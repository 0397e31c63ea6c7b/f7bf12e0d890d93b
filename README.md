It has been a long way, we have reached the end.

From what started as a joke in a group chat, to an entire project with years of effort. We present to you, the 17th version of Drainer Drainer 123, the finale and the end of it all, Harp.

Harp, named after Harpocrates, the Greek god of silence, aims to bring back the greatness of the "Drainer Drainer 123" project. The past scripts have always been announcing that the user is getting their Robux drained, while this script avoids that. 

Harp uses the same approach as the first ever drainer script made, ending it all from where it started.

Harp is the last version of the drainer, but this does not mean that it will not be getting updates. It may occasionally get updates to bypass executor security.

We hope to see you in the other side. Signing off.

Fun fact: This project was inspired directly by synttax's work in 2019, and was made before Latte Softworks started abusing RCE vulnerabilities in executors!
